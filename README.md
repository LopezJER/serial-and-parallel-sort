# Comparative Analysis of Serial and Parallel Sorting Algorithms

The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of serial and parallel sorting algorithms.
Specifically, it sought to:

1. implement various serial and parallel sorting algorithms;
2. compare and contrast the performance of serial and parallel implementations;
3. recommend the most efficient sorting algorithm for general-purpose sorting.

## Analysis
Please read the results and discussion section of the PDF report on this repository.

## Running Sorting Algorithms
Please read the separate readme files for instructions on how to run the implementations which are located in their respective subdirectories.
